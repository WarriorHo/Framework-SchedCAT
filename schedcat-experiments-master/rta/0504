Now Consumer is set correctly, including the number of consumer and priority.
Execution is run in utilization.py.
Different Delta between Omnilog And NODROP is set in params.py.
Some parts of rta_omnilog.py and rta_nodrop.py are improved (about execution).
Function run_util_num_config is complete.

Function run_tests has a question about param "mem".

Function setup_tests, check Function rt_parsec_test_linear, Initialization part is wroten.
def rt_parsec_test_linear(taskset_in, oh, conf):
    mem = 0
    ts = copy.deepcopy(taskset_in)
    charge_parsec_overheads(oh, ts, conf)
    ncores = int(conf.num_cpus)
    q_arpha_c = oh.parsec_q[ncores]
    q_beta_c = oh.mem_free[ncores]
    q_mem = int(conf.num_mem)
    max_q = ts.max_period()
    min_q = get_min_qui_period(ts)
    q = Quiescence(q_arpha_c, q_beta_c, q_mem)
    q.period = max_q
IS SIMILAR TO
def rta_nodrop_test(taskset, oh, conf, include_consumers=True):
    ts = taskset
    if not include_consumers:
        ts = TaskSystem([t for t in ts if not t.is_consumer])
    # framework = AuditFramework('nodrop', delta=conf.delta, alpha=conf.alpha, beta=conf.beta)
    framework = get_framework('nodrop')
    for t in ts:
        t.cost = framework.calculate_execution_time(t)
HOWEVER, how to create qk_ratio haven't be done, so i need to leave space for the function.

OMNILOG have need to think of the partition and rewrite rta_omnilog or somthing.

CPU need to be added into utilization.

System Count need to rewrite.
